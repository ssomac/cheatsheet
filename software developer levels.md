# software developer levels

[link](https://medium.com/@cgroom/the-software-engineering-job-ladder-4bf70b4c24f3)

* Level 1
  * External title: [Junior] Software Engineer
  * Role: Builds defined features, investigates and fixes bugs, writes tests. Communicates progress, identifies blocking issues. Finds a work-life balance.
  * Anti-patterns: Poor code quality. Not self-motivated; needs someone to tell them what to do next. Constantly veers into the weeds. More inclined to blame-complain than roll up sleeves. General helplessness. Disregards team process.
  * Experience: ~0–3 years

Junior engineers bring a lot of raw energy and potential to a company. They “do work” you give them — often, quite a lot of it. They need help with up-front project planning and the breakdown of tasks into specific chunks of work. Team leads should check in fairly often to make sure they’re on-track and have direction. Let go of level-1 engineers who won’t be promoted to level-2 within 2 years.

* Level 2
  * External title: [Senior] Software Engineer
  * Role: Owns a functional area. Breaks large requests down into sub-tasks, gives higher-level status updates. Writes test plans. Takes operational responsibility. Sets measurable goals, and meets them. Reviews code changes. Helps mentor new hires.
  * Anti-patterns: Disappears into projects that don’t matter to the business. Fails to identify or communicate big roadblocks. Us-vs-them attitude. Continually underestimates timelines. Doesn’t take operational excellence seriously. Solutions are more complicated than necessary.
  * Experience: ~1–8 years

Level-2 engineers can take ownership over a body of significant software. You can trust them to take loosely defined requests and do the right thing — break down complex tasks, make reasonable decisions, and operate fairly independently between periodic check-ins. Communication and critical thinking skills are essential.

While someone can be a level-2 engineer for several years, eventually they should demonstrate they can take on more ownership and be promoted to level-3, or leave the organization.

* Level 3
  * External title: Senior Software Engineer
  * Role: Owns the development and rollout for an entire product, or large project. Champions process (Scrum, TDD, etc). Writes tech specs and identifies risks before starting major projects. Sets standards. Goes out of their way to reduce complexity. As needed, takes on additional “tech lead” responsibilities for driving an initiative to completion.
  * Anti-patterns: Arrogant jerk. Doesn’t delegate. Always says “yes” and suffers burn-out. Jumps into execution without careful consideration. Lets details slip through the cracks. Fails to raise awareness of projects at risk or people-problems. Doesn’t follow new technologies or industry tends.
  * Experience: ~5+ years

Level-3 engineers take ownership over a whole product (e.g. an entire application, or suite of services). In additional to delivering solid and maintainable software, they understand company dynamics and good process.

Senior engineers often wear an additional “tech lead” hat. This means they take on the (thankless) work of project management and process oversight. They keep the trains running on time. Note that a tech lead does not have direct reports and does not boss people around; they lead by gravitas.

This can be a career position. It’s perfectly normal to have solid level-3 engineers who are happy being individual contributors, and don’t want to move to management or general architecture.

* Level 4 (and beyond)
  * External title: Architect (or Principal Engineer, or invent a cool title)
  * Role: Owns cross-team shared infrastructure. Works with CTO and other architects to choose new technologies, and promote culture / process. Has deep technical expertise in a business-critical area. Does serious research to evaluate and test options. Understands implications (and trade-offs) of reliability, scalability, operational costs, ease of adoption by organization, recruiting, etc.
  * Anti-patterns: Over-emphasis on scaling or high availability far beyond business needs. Spends too much time chasing the newest “shiny” technology. Doesn’t collaborate or ask questions. Condescending. Has “pet” agenda. Pisses off senior leadership.
  * Experience: ~8+ years

Level-4 engineers are architects who can evaluate system-wide platform decisions and set long-term company-wide technical strategy. They often have two roles, working both as individual contributors on a feature team and also as architectural reviewers working with the CTO. Your architects should be humble and outgoing; they are your engineering cheerleaders.
